# CMD-Macro
CMD Macro is a small unfinished interpreter I been working on

I am deciding to release the source in the hope I may find some people to help me finish it off.

-It supports two variable types int and string
-You can read and write to the console.
-Evalulate math expressions
-Works with strings
-Work with numbers

See example folder for more info.
