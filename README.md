# CMD-Macro
CMD Macro is a small unfinished interpreter I been working on

I am deciding to release the source in the hope I may find some people to help me finish it off.

tested on gcc and compiles fine, I not tested it in visual studio with a few some changes.
- It supports two variable types int and string
- You can read and write to the console.
- Evaluate math expressions
- Works with strings
- Work with numbers
See example folder for more info.
