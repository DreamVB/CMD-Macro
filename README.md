# CMD-Macro
CMD Macro is a small unfinished interpreter I been working on

<p>I am deciding to release the source in the hope I may find some people to help me finish it off</p>

<p>tested on gcc and compiles fine, I not tested it in visual studio with a few some changes.</p>
<p>See example folder for more info.</p>

- It supports two variable types int and string
- You can read and write to the console.
- Evaluate math expressions
- Works with strings
